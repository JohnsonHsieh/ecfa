Dear Professors,

A democracy crisis is happening in Taiwan, my home country. Taiwanese
students and citizens are now occupying legislative Yuan (Congress) and
Executive Yuan to protect the value of democracy. The administration party,
the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), is trying to pass the Cross-Strait
Service Trade Agreement between Taiwan and China through an injustice way
that overlooks public interests and national security.

I am worried that a violent revolution will break out in the near future. No
one wants this happen. What other ways can I do to ask for assistance from
other countries or world-wide organizations?

The protesters are requesting the government withdraw the agreement and
re-discuss it after the legislatures could pass the Monitoring Mechanism for
Cross-Strait Agreements in the Current Legislative Session. However, six days
have passed but the President of Taiwan and his administration have not
directly answered this request. Instead, they continually insist that this
agreement is beneficial to all citizens (which is doubtful) and must be
passed. (The detail of proclaims. English version is at the
bottom:https://www.facebook.com/lslandnationyouth/posts/242992019217385)

The protesters have already successfully submitted PETITION THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION

United States Senator SHERROD BROWN of Ohio and Congressman ED ROYCE of
California have showed their support for the protest and also point out some
moves that Taiwan could do to be less dependent to just one country.

I will deeply appreciate you if you can give me some advice to advocate or to
help with this major event in Taiwan now.

感謝大家。
